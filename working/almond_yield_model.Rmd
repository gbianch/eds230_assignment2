```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
#read in the data 
climate <- read.table(here("data", "clim.txt")) %>% 
  row_to_names(row_number = 1) %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) 

feb_temp <- climate %>% 
  filter(month == 2)

feb_min <- min(feb_temp$tmin_c)
feb_max <- max(feb_temp$tmin_c)

jan_precip <- climate %>% 
  filter(month == 1) 

jan_total <- sum(jan_precip$precip)

# test function
almond_modelR(climate, 2000)

```


the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately 1920 ton/acre
the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately -0.027 ton/acre
the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately 182 ton/acre
